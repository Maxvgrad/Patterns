## OO Basics
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

## OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varies 
2. Favor composition over inheritence
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
5. Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
